<h1><u>Like Predicate Page</u><h1>
<br>
<p>
Our like predicate for the searching is used only on the title while searching.
We have it search so that a search for "men" will return results for both "Men In Black"
AND "The Fifth Element" because the string "the" can be found somewhere in the title.
</p>
<p>
We use the same method of searching using the like in the advanced search. However,
we only use the like predicate for the title aspect of the searching. It will not be
applied to the year, director, or star name.
